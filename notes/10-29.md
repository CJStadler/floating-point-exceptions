Steps:
1. Generate SMT
2. Solve to get input candidates
3. Test inputs on P and P', searching if necessary

- Ariadne modified KLEE to use Z3 because it has a theory of reals.
- KLEE supports Z3, but not treating floats as reals.
- How to generate SMT?
  1. Modify KLEE to use Real type for floats (like Ariadne).
  2. Generate SMT by hand.

- How to compare P and P'?
  - Exception traces
  - Any exceptions?
  - Compare outputs.

- Could we solve for inputs that generate an exception in only one of P and P'?

- Compare exception traces just using order of exceptions (no line numbers).
- Two traces are equivalent if they have exceptions in the same order.

## TODO
- What do the formulas generated by KLEE-FP look like? How easy to translate to
  Real formulas?
- Try uninterpreted function with KLEE
- Try with manually instrumented
- Then implement LLVM pass

Int hack:
1. `double` -> `int` in source
2. Instrument IR with checks
3. Run KLEE to get SMT
4. `int` -> `real` in SMT
