### a
- clang's `-Ofast` enables `-ffast-math`, in addition to other things.
  - But `-ffast-math` by itself doesn't do the expected transformations.

- gcc with `-ffast-math` catches the exceptions.
- clang with `-Ofast` exceptions are not caught in any of them

### b
- clang optimized `double nnan = -0.0 / 0.0` to a single assignment (of 0) even
  without `-Ofast`. To work around this I explicitly assigned the two values to
variables first.
- With `-Ofast` (or even `-O1`) clang optimizes everything down to a single
  print call.

- gcc
  - No flags
    - prints 0
    - exception caught
  - `-ffast-math`
    - prints 1
    - exception caught
- clang
  - No flags
    - prints 0
    - exception caught
  - `-Ofast`
    - prints 0
    - Exception not caught

- What is this intended to illustrate about signed zeroes? If the negative sign
  is removed the same behavior is observed.

- `exception_fast_only.c` attempts to only hit an overflow if optimized via
  factorization.
  - With no optimizations it returns a number and does not raise an exception.
  - With `gcc -ffast-math` or `clang -O1 -ffast-math` it returns inf and raises
    overflow. IR shows expected optimization.
  - With `clang -Ofast` it returns inf and does not raise.
    - Skips the actual calculation
