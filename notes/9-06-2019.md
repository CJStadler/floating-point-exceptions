### a
- clang's `-Ofast` enables `-ffast-math`, in addition to other things.
  - But `-ffast-math` by itself doesn't do the expected transformations.

- gcc with `-ffast-math` catches the exceptions.
- clang with `-Ofast` exceptions are not caught in any of them

### b
- clang optimized `double nnan = -0.0 / 0.0` to a single assignment (of 0) even
  without `-Ofast`. To work around this I explicitly assigned the two values to
variables first.
- With `-Ofast` clang optimizes everything down to a single print call.

- gcc
  - No flags
    - prints 0
    - exception caught
  - `-ffast-math`
    - prints 1
    - exception caught
- clang
  - No flags
    - prints 0
    - exception caught
  - `-Ofast`
    - prints 0
    - Exception not caught

- What is this intended to illustrate about signed zeroes? If the negative sign
  is removed the same behavior is observed.
