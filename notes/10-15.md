- Manually instrument turbine1 with exception checks. Translate to formula.
  Solve formula to find inputs that trigger exceptions (in the unoptimized).
- Ideally we could write formulas that find inputs that have a difference in the
  optimized and unoptimized.
- Do optimizations only cause exceptions to be removed, or can they introduce
  exceptions?
  - If they only cause exceptions to be removed then we can just instrument
    those operations which are changed by the optimization?

```
a = x * 2
b = a / 2
```
=>
```
b = x
```
